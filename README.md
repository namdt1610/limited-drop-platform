# Limited Drop Platform: High-Concurrency Inventory Engine

## System Architectural Profile

A specialized transactional engine designed to handle "thundering herd" traffic spikes during limited inventory sales. The system architecture prioritizes consistent latency and data integrity over distributed complexity, utilizing a **Single-Writer / Multi-Reader (SWMR)** model backed by an embedded storage engine.

### Performance Optimization Strategy

The core architectural decision moves away from traditional networked RDBMS (Postgres, MySQL) to eliminate Network Round-Trip Time (RTT) and leverage the specific performance characteristics of NVMe storage.

- **Zero-RTT Data Access**: Database runs in-process. Query latency is strictly bounded by Syscall overhead + Disk I/O, typically <50µs for reads.
- **Write Serialization (Amdahl's Law optimization)**: By strictly limiting the Write Connection Pool to 1 (`SetMaxOpenConns(1)`), the system moves write contention from the Database Lock layer to the Application Mutex layer. This eliminates "Busy Wait" CPU cycles in the storage engine and ensures a strictly ordered FIFO write queue.
- **IOPS Optimization**: Storage engine configured with `_synchronous=NORMAL` and `_journal_mode=WAL` (Write-Ahead-Log).
  - _Reduction of `fsync()` calls_: Commit durability relies on the OS page cache for intermediate states, trading extreme power-loss durability for a 10x throughput increase.
  - _Non-Blocking Reads_: Readers traverse memory-mapped WAL frames, unblocked by concurrent writes.
- **Transaction Serialization (`_txlock=immediate`)**: Upgrades all transactions to `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` at the driver level. This ensures that the writer acquires a reserved lock immediately upon starting a transaction, preventing "SQLITE_BUSY" deadlocks and ensuring deterministic latency under high contention.

## Infrastructure Stack

- **Compute Runtime**: Go 1.25 (Goroutine scheduler optimized for IO-bound work)
- **Storage Engine**: SQLite3 (Custom Tuning: WAL, Shared Cache, 5s Busy Timeout)
- **Network Transport**: Fiber (req/res zero-allocation path)
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js (Low JS footprint, Client-side state reduction)

## Component Deep Dive

### 1. Concurrency Control (The "Mutex vs Lock" Strategy)

Instead of relying on row-level locking (Postgres `SELECT FOR UPDATE`) which can lead to deadlock detection overhead during high contention:

1.  **Ingress**: Requests hit the HTTP handler.
2.  **Queue**: Write transactions queue at the Go SQL Driver's internal mutex (capacity: 1).
3.  **Execution**: The single writer executes an **Atomic Conditional Update**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE limited_drops
    SET sold = sold + ?
    WHERE id = ? AND sold + ? <= total_stock
    ```
4.  **Result**: The storage engine returns `RowsAffected`. If 0, the application returns `409 Conflict`.
    - _Constraint_: Logic executes at C-level speed within the storage engine.
    - _Outcome_: Zero possibility of overselling. Zero deadlock risk.

### 2. Syscall & I/O Pattern

- **Read Path**: `mmap()` (via SQLite Shared Cache). Hot pages stay in RAM. No disk seek.
- **Write Path**: Sequential append to WAL file. Random I/O is deferred to Checkpoint (Background thread).

## Deployment & Operations

**Build & Link**

```bash
# CGO_ENABLED=1 is required for sqlite3 driver
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o dist/engine ./cmd/server
# Binary Size: ~15MB (Statically linked except glibc)
```

**Runtime Metrics (Idle / Load)**

- **Memory Footprint**: ~12MB / ~45MB RSS (Go GC tuned)
- **Goroutines**: ~10 / ~2000+ (Linear scaling with connections)

**Start Sequence**

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## Security & Integrity

- **Idempotency Key**: SHA-256 HMAC signature verification on all mutating webhooks (PayOS).
- **Transaction Boundaries**: All inventory mutations are ACID compliant.
- **Supply Chain**: Reproducible builds via `go.sum` and pinned Docker base images.
